# android-to-ios-plist
A standalone Python 3 script that reads Android‑style XML save games (with &lt;map>, &lt;list>, &lt;int>, &lt;float>, &lt;bool>, etc.), maps and converts their keys and types (including percent‑unescaping names), and outputs a fully compatible iOS XML Property List (.plist) with preserved structure and order.
